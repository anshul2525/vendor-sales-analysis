Effective inventory and sales management is critical for optimizing profitability

inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, and over-dependence on specific vendors.

- Identify underperforming brands requiring pricing or promotional adjustments
- Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit
- Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs
- Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency
- Compare profitability between high-performing and low-performing vendors
